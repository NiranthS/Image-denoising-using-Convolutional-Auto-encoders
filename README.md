# Denoising-using-CNN

Image denoising is a well-studied problem in Computer Vision as well as a test bed for low-level image modelling algorithms. For this task I used a fully Convolutional auto-encoder network for image restoring. The network consists of multiple convolution and deconvolution(transposed convolution) layers, learning mapping from corrupted images to original images. 
* The convolutional layers capture the contents of the image while eliminating the noise.
* The deconvolution(transposed convolution) layers upsample the feature maps and recover the details of the image.
## Skip Connections
Skip connections are added from a convolutional layer to its corresponding mirrored deconvolution(transposed convolution) layer.
These skip connections exhibit two major advantages:
* They pass image details from convolutional layers to deconvolutional(transposed convolution) layers which is useful in recovering the clean image.
* They allow signal to be back-propagated directly to the layers at the starting and hence tackling the problem of vanishing gradients.

## Architecture
* The network is fully convolutional and deconvolutional(transposed convolution).
* The convolutional and deconvolutional(transposed convolution) layers are symmetric.
* ReLU/Leaky ReLU are used after every convolutional and deconvolutional(transposed convolution) layer.
* Pooling/unpooling is not used as pooling discards useful image details that are useful for these kind of tasks.
* Skip connections are added from a convolutional layes to its corresponding deconvolutional(transposed convolution) layer.

## Image denoising
* CIFAR-10 dataset is used in this task.
* An additive Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.1,0.3,0.5 is used in this task.
